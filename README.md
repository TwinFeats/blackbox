The class Parker Bros game BlackBox was one of my childhood favorites. The player sends in rays to a black box and observe where the ray exists the box according to some simple rules.

I've written this game on many platforms in many different languages and technologies over the decades, this being the latest incarnation. The code is by no means pretty or written with best-practices, it is simply written quickly in a couple of days as a labor of love for logical games. Enjoy!
